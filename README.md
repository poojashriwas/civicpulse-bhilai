# CivicPulse Bhilai

CivicPulse Bhilai is a web-based civic issue reporting and visualization platform designed to help citizens report local infrastructure problems and assist authorities in identifying high-impact areas for faster action.


##  Problem Statement

In many cities, civic issues such as drainage blockages, water supply problems, and power cuts are reported through scattered and inefficient channels.  
There is no centralized, location-based system to visualize these issues and detect repeated problems in the same areas.

##  Solution

CivicPulse Bhilai provides a simple web platform where users can:
- Report civic issues with location details
- View reported issues on an interactive map
- Store complaints securely in a real-time database
- Identify repeated issues from the same locations to highlight critical zones

This helps authorities prioritize actions and improve response time.

##  Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Maps:** Google Maps JavaScript API  
- **Backend / Database:** Firebase Firestore  
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting  

##  Key Features

- Location-based civic issue reporting  
- Interactive Google Map with issue markers  
- Real-time data storage using Firestore  
- Detection of repeated issues from the same area  
- Scalable and lightweight web application  

##  How It Works

1. User submits a civic complaint through the web interface  
2. Complaint data is stored in Firebase Firestore  
3. Location data is plotted on Google Maps  
4. Repeated complaints from the same area indicate high-priority zones  
5. Authorities can analyze affected areas visually  

##  Deployment

The project is hosted using **Firebase Hosting** and accessible via a secure HTTPS URL.
